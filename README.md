Cheeper's Backend

### For run developer Backend
  * npm run dev

## ¡Important!
  * Before that, check the env.example and create a new .env.

### If you want to use my Postman Routes.
Go to my Postman Team, join up and Click over this url:
https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=6cfa2ad91b05b96ce2309754ee88f474

#### ¡Important about Postman Routes!
I`m using environment to replace 'https://localhost:3000' for {{url}}
if you don't use this config, you have two options:
  * Create a environment with url like variable.
  * Replace {{url}} for 'https://localhost:3000' in every Postman route.



Happy hack!!
