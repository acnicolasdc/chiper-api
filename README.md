### If you want to use my Postman Routes.
  Go to my Postman Team, join up and Click over this url:
  https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=6cfa2ad91b05b96ce2309754ee88f474

#### Â¡Important about Postman Routes!
  I`m using environment to replace 'https://localhost:3000' for {{url}}
  if you don't use this config, you have two options:
    * Create a environment with url like variable.
    * Replace {{url}} for 'https://localhost:3000' in every Postman route.



Happy hack!!
